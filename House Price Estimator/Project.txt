Loading and Cleaning Data:
  The dataset is loaded, and columns like 'society', 'area_type', 
  'balcony', and 'availability' are removed.
  The dataset is cleaned by removing rows with missing values.
Feature Engineering:
  New features are created, such as bhk (number of bedrooms) by 
  parsing the 'size' column.
  The 'total_sqft' column, which sometimes contains ranges or
  different units, is converted into a numerical form.
Outlier Detection and Removal:
  A column price_per_sqft is created by dividing the price by 
  the total square footage. Properties with extreme or inconsistent values, such as too 
  small properties for the number of bedrooms, are removed.
  Outliers are also removed by location based on standard deviations from the mean price_per_sqft for that location.
  Specific outliers based on the number of bathrooms in comparison to bedrooms are also filtered out.
Visualization:
  Scatter plots are generated for different locations like "Rajaji Nagar" and "Hebbal", 
  showing the relationship between the total square feet and price for 2 BHK and 3 BHK properties.
  Histograms of price per square feet and the number of bathrooms are plotted.
Dummy Variables for Locations:
  Location data is transformed into dummy variables (one-hot encoding) to prepare for machine learning models.
